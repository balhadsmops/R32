# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🧠 RAG SYSTEM COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETE - Conducted extensive testing of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation as requested in review. CRITICAL FIX: Resolved JSON serialization issue with numpy data types (int64, float64) that was preventing RAG collection creation - converted all statistical calculations to Python native types. MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS: ✅ RAG Service Functionality: ChromaDB vector database integration working perfectly with persistent storage at /tmp/chroma_db, sentence-transformers embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), and successful collection creation. ✅ Query Classification System: Tested diverse query types (descriptive, correlation, visualization, medical prevalence) - all properly classified and processed with appropriate context retrieval. ✅ Semantic Search: Vector search functioning excellently with 5 relevant results retrieved per query, proper embedding generation and storage. ✅ Data Chunking Strategies: All chunking methods operational (row-based, column-based, statistical summaries, correlation matrices) with proper metadata serialization. ✅ RAG Chat Integration: Chat endpoint fully integrated with RAG context - tested with medical dataset queries achieving 100% success rate (4/4 queries processed successfully). ✅ Medical Data Examples: Tested with clinical data including patient demographics, vital signs, and medical conditions - all queries processed with proper medical context understanding. RESULTS: RAG system working excellently with all 6 core components fully functional. Backend logs confirm proper query classification, context retrieval, and LLM integration. The RAG implementation provides sophisticated context-aware responses for statistical analysis queries."
